Cognito Forms API Key: You need a Cognito Forms API key for authentication. If you don‚Äôt have one, you can request it from your Cognito Forms account.

Usage
1. Retrieve the Base URL from Cognito Forms
To obtain the base URL for a specific form:

Go to https://www.cognitoforms.com/copythis/ (replace "copythis" with your own account's base URL).
The URL for the base form page will be in the format: https://www.cognitoforms.com/<YourBasePath>.
Use this <YourBasePath> when prompted by the script.
2. Running the Script
Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy code
python cognito_forms_scraper.py
3. Walkthrough of the Script
The script will first ask for your Cognito Forms API key.
Then, it will auto-detect your Chrome username and ask you if you want to use it.
You will need to manually log in to Cognito Forms when prompted.
After login, the script will list the forms that have entries.
The script will then scrape the entries and simulate deletion (can be toggled by setting the dry_run parameter).
If there are 25 or more entries, it will refresh the page to continue processing.
